# Weather You Run

## Basic Information

Weather You Run is a web application where users can:
* Look up the current weather 
* See suggested gear needed
* Log/edit and delete runs. 

## Technologies Used
 * HTML/CSS/JavaScript
 * Bootstrap
 * Bcrypt
 * Mongoose
 * Express
 * Angular
 * Node
 * Google Fonts
 * Open Weather Map API

## In the Future
Would love to implement Facebook OAuth, add images for suggested clothing and add a gps tracker to track run distance/time without logging. 

## Known Issues
There are still a lot of bugs! Haven't worked out all CRUD kinks and would like to make input fields easier to edit.

## User Stories
* Runner would like to check the weather and figure out what the best clothing is for 35 degree weather. Hat? Shorts? 
* Runner returns from run and would like to keep track of what went wrong/what went right.  Logs run basics and makes a note not to drink more than 1 cup of coffee before running that distance.
